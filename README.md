# System-level-design-and-modeling

This repository contains the solutions for the assignments from the 'Methodologies for System Level Design Modeling' course (ECE5723) taken at Worcester Polytechnic Institute - WPI in the Fall 2020. The repository includes 6 projects, namely:

1 - Logic Design, VHDL Modeling, and Testbench. </br>
2 - RT Level Design and C++ Logic Modeling. </br>
3 - C++ RT Level Design and Modeling. </br>
4 - SystemC RTL Design. </br>
5 - SystemC Channels. </br>
6 - SystemC Transaction Level Modeling. </br>

During the course, various digital hardware systems were modeled using C++ and SystemC.

The detailed information about the projects is contained in the attached reports placed in the corresponding subfolders.

# Used software
1. Visual Studio 2019 - IDE [visualstudio.microsoft.com].
2. draw.io - for drawing diagrams [https://app.diagrams.net/].
3. WaveDrom - for drawing waveforms [https://wavedrom.com/].
4. GTKWave - VCD viewer [http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/].

# Dependencies
For the projects 4-6, SystemC-2.3.3 (includes TLM) C++ library was used [https://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc].</br>
The corresponding subfolders contain the file named 'Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user.props'. This file contains the data about dependencies.</br>
This propert sheet may be exported into Visual Studio 2019 through the built-in Property Manager.
