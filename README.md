# System-level-design-and-modeling

This repository contains the solutions for the assignments from the 'Methodologies for System Level Design Modeling' course (ECE5723) taken at Worcester Polytechnic Institute - WPI in the Fall 2020. The repository includes 6 projects, namely:

1 - Logic Design, VHDL Modeling, and Testbench. </br>
2 - RT Level Design and C++ Logic Modeling. </br>
3 - C++ RT Level Design and Modeling. </br>
4 - SystemC RTL Design. </br>
5 - SystemC Channels. </br>
6 - SystemC Transaction Level Modeling. </br>

During the course, various digital hardware systems were modeled using C++ and SystemC.

The detailed information about the projects is contained in the attached reports placed in the corresponding subfolders.
